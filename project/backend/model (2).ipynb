(i) In the instant case, the agreement to pay =10,000 in exchange for a service (providing  Under Section 10 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a valid contract requires free information about prospective grooms) is lawful. Hence, the agreement is valid.  (ii)According to section 20, where both the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, there is a bilateral mistake. In such a case, the agreement is void. Sieh >  (iii)In the instant case, the bull's death (unknown to both parties) constitutes a bilateral mistake regarding the subject matter of the contract.  Hence, the agreement is void.Under Section 27, agreements in restraint of trade are void. However, an exception is provided for contracts involving the sale of goodwill. The local limits within which the | S+ep 3 seller of the goodwill agrees not to carry on similar business must be reasonable.  In the instant case, the restriction is limited to the local area and does not extend indefinitely. Siep3  Hence, the agreement is valid.  (iv)According to section 12, a contract by a person who is not of sound mind is void.  In the instant case, a property worth Rs. 2,00,000 was agreed to be sold for just Rs. S4ep4 25,000 by a person of unsound mind.  Hence, the agreement is void.     1(b) Formation of companies with charitable ebjects etc. (Sectien 8 company):  e Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013 deals with the formation of companies which are formed to  © promote the charitable objects of commerce, art, science, sports, education, research, social welfare, religion, charity, protection of environment etc. Sieh | © Such company intends to apply its profit in © promoting its objects and © prohibiting the payment of any dividend to its members. e The Section 8 company operates under a special licence from Central Government and the Licence revoked if conditions contravened.  e On revocation, Central Government may direct it to  sacl, ga.  o Converts its status and change its name  oO Wind — up  o Amalgamate with another company having similar object. e A partnership firm can be a member of Section 8 company.  In the instant case, “Harmony Foundation” a section 8 company transferred some amount to M/S LMP Associates (a Partnership firm and one of the members of the Harmony Foundation).  The Central Government, after giving an opportunity of being heard, directed the company to be wound up on the ground that a partnership firm cannot be a member of the Section 8 company and it cannot transfer any part of profit to the firm.  Hence, the ground for winding up taken on the basis of transfer of any part of profit by Harmony Foundation to the M/S LMP Associates is correct and sufficient.  However, M/S LMP Associates can become a member of Section 8 company. Therefore, this ground is not correct hence not sufficient.     1(b)(ii)  Section  of the Companies Act, 2013 contains the following provisions:  Manner of inclusion of the entrenchment provisien: The provisions for entrenchment shall only be made either on formation of a company, or by an amendment in the articles agreed to by all the members of the company in the case of a private company and by a special resolution in the case of a public company.  Notice to the registrar of the entrenchment provision: Where the articles contain provisions for entrenchment, whether made on formation or by amendment, the company shall give notice to the Registrar of such provisions in such form and manner as may be prescribed.  Step |  Siep2  Step |  In the instant case, Justice Private Limited can follow the above procedure i.e. with the consent of ali the members and notice to the registrar to include the entrenchment provision in its Articles. Ciep2.  Yes, the advice will differ, if the company is public company, since it has to pass Special Resolution and also inform to the registrar.     1(c)  Though a minor cannot be a partner in a firm, he can nonetheless be admitted to the benefits of partnership under Section 30 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. The following are the Rights and Liabilities (before attaining majority):  (1) Rights: | (i) | A minor partner has a right to his agreed share of the profits and of the |  firm. . |  |  (ii) He can have access to, inspect and copy the accounts of the firm. siebl  (iii) He can sue the partners for accounts or for payment of his share but | only when severing his connection with the firm, and not otherwise.  (iv) On attaining majority, he may within 6 months elect to become a partner or not to become a partner. If he elects to become a partner, then he is entitled to the share to which he was entitled as a minor. If | he does not, then his share is not liable for any acts of the firm after the date of the public notice served to that effect. |  (2) Liabilities: | Before attaining majority:  (a) The liability of the minor is confined only to the extent of his | St#p 2 share in the profits and the property of the firm.  (b) Minor has no personal liability for the debts of the firm incurred during his minority.  A  eee  (c) Minor cannot be declared insolvent, but if the firm is declared insolvent his share in the firm vests in the Official Receiver/Assignee (which means minor can recover his share in the firm on_ proportionate basis from official receiv er/assignee)   2(a)  According to Section 18 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, where there is a contract of sale for unascertained goods, the property in goods cannot pass to the buyer unless and until the goods are ascertained. The buyer can get the ownership right on the goods only when the goods are specific and ascertained.  According to section 20 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, where there is an Step | unconditional contract for sale of specific goods in deliverable state, the property in  the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made, and it is immaterial whether  the time of payment of price or the time of delivery of the goods, or both, is postponed. Here, the condition is goods must be ready for delivery.  In the instant case, since the microchips were specifically identified and were in a deliverable state when the contract was formed on August 1, 2023, ownership (and risk) likely passed to PQR Enterprises on August 1, 2023. Therefore, POR Enterprises will suffer the loss.  Step Goods are not specifically identified and ascertained:  if the microchips were not specifically identified and marked for PQR Enterprises at the time of the contract, MNO Limited will suffer the loss, as the risk would not have transferred to PQR Enterprises.   2(a)(ii)  As per Section 27 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, “no one can transfer a better title than they themselves have.” This means that a person who is not the owner of goods cannot convey ownership unless authorized by the true owner.  Also, Section 14-a imposes an implied condition in every contract of sale PI  that the seller has the right to sell the goods means he should be the real owner. If the seller's title turns out to be defective, the buyer must return the goods to the true owner and recover the price from the seller.  In the instant case. A will succeed in his action against B for the return of the price, as B had no title to sell the stolen motorcycle, and the sale was in breach of the implied condition.       2(b)  The Articies of Association are in fact the Bye-Laws of the company according to  which director and other officers are required to perform their functions as regards  the management of the company, its accounts and audit. It is important therefore that  the auditor should study them and, while doing so he should note the provisions . Sieh |  therein in respect of relevant matters.  Section 5 of the Companies Act, 2013 seeks to provide the contents and model  of articles of association. The section lays the following law-  (1) Contains regulations: The articles of a company shall contain the regulations for management of the company.    Inclusion of matters: The articles shall also contain such matters, as are prescribed under the rules. However, a company may also include such additional matters in its articles as may be considered necessary for its management.  Contain provisions for entrenchment: The articles may contain provisions for entrenchment (to protect something) to the effect that specified provisions of the articles may be altered only if conditions or procedures as that are more restrictive than those applicable in the case of a special resolution, are met or complied with.  Manner of inclusion of the entrenchment provision: The provisions for entrenchment shali only be made either on formation of a company, or by an amendment in the articles agreed to by all the members of the company in the case of a private company and by a special resolution in the case of a public company.  Notice to the registrar of the entrenchment provision: Where the articles contain provisions for entrenchment, whether made on formation or by amendment, the company shall give notice to the Registrar of such provisions in such form and manner as may be prescribed.  Forms of articles: The articles of a company shall be in respective forms specified in Tables, F, G, H, I and J in Schedule I as may be applicable to such company.  Model articles: A company may adopt all or any of the regulations contained in the model articles applicable to such company.  Company registered after the commencement of this Act: In case of any company, which is registered after the commencement of this Act, in so far as the registered articles of such company do not exclude or modify the regulations contained in the model articles applicable to such company, those regulations shall, so far as applicable, be the regulations of that company in the same manner and to the extent as if they were contained in the duly registered articles of the company.    2(c)  Incorporation document (Section 11 of the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008): The most important document needed for registration is the incorporation  document.  (1) ForaLLP to be incorporated:  two or more persons associated for carrying on a lawful business with a view to profit shall subscribe their names to an incorporation document:  the incorporation document shall be filed in such manner and with such fees, as may be prescribed with the Registrar of the State in which the registered office of the LLP is to be situated; and  Statement to be filed:  > there shall be filed along with the incorporation document, a statement in the prescribed form,  > made by either an advocate, or a Company Secretary or a Chartered Accountant or a Cost Accountant, who is engaged in the formation of the LLP and  Sep | > by any one who subscribed his name to the incorporation document, > that all the requirements of this Act and the rules made thereunder have been complied with, > in respect of incorporation and matters precedent and incidental thereto.  (2) The incorporation document shal]—  be in a form as may be prescribed;  state the name of the LLP;  state the proposed business of the LLP;  state the address of the registered office of the LLP;  state the name and address of each of the persons who are to be partners of the LLP on incorporation;  state the name and address of the persons who are to be designated partners of the LLP on incorporation;  contain such other information concerning the proposed LLP as may be prescribed.  (3) Ifaperson makes a statement as discussed above which he—  (a)knows to be false; or  (b) does not believe to be true, shall be punishable r with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years and  > with fine which shall not be less than Rs. 10,000 but which may extend to Rs. 5 Lakhs.  Step |  Incorporation by registration Section 12- Sufficient evidence:  As per section 12, the Registrar may accept the statement delivered under  clause  of sub-section of section 11 as sufficient evidence that the requirement imposed by clause  of the sub-section has been complied CHep2 with.  In view of above, the statement filed along with the incorporation document serves as sufficient evidence that all legal requirements for the incorporation of the LLP have been fulfilled.    3(a)  The given question is based on the Section 18 read with sections 25 & 26 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932. Section 18 deais with the Partner to be an agent of the firm. This means that a partner is the agent of the firm for the purpose of the business of the firm.  The partner indeed virtually holds the character of both a principal and an agent. So as far as he acts for himself and in his own interest in the common concern of the partnership, he may properly be deemed a principal and so far as he acts for his partners, he may properly be deemed as an agent. Step |  The rule that a partner is the agent of the firm for the purpose of the business of the firm camnot be applied to all transactions and dealings between the partners themselves. It is applicable only to the act done by partners for the purpose of the business of the firm.  According to section 25, the partners are jointly and severally responsible to third parties for all acts which come under the scope of their express or implied authority. “Act of firm’ cennetes any act er omission by all the partners or by any partner or agent of the firm, which gives rise to a right enforceable by or against the firm.  As per section 26, the firm is liable to the same extent as the partner for any loss or injury caused to a third party by the wrongful acts of a partner, if they are done by the partner while acting:     in the ordinary course of the business of the firm  with the authority of the partners. Step According to the facts given in the questions, P, a partner to PQR Associates, buys cement on behalf of the firm from D in the ordinary course of the firm’s business. P uses the cement for his personal purposes. D, the supplier was unaware of the private use of cement by P and claims price from the firm. Firm refuses to pay the price on the ground that the cement was never received by it.  Step 2  Referring to the stated provisions of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932, following are the answers:  (i) Said Section is applicable only to the act done by partners for the purpose of the business of the firm. In such case, partner act as the agent of the firm for the purpose of the business of the firm. Since in the given case, P, buys cement on behaif of the firm from D in the ordinary course of the firm’s business.  Therefore, in the given case, firms’ contention of refusal to pay the price on the ground that the cement was never received by it, is not tenable.  (ii) Further for commission of the wrongful act by the partner, the firm is s+ eh liable to the same extent as the partner for any loss or injury caused to a third party by the wrongful acts of a partner, if they are done by the  partner while acting: (a) in the ordinary course of the business of the firm (b) with the authority of the partners.  In the given case, part of the cement so purchased by P was delivered to the firm by him and the rest of the cement was used by him for his private use, was not known to the firm and the supplier. Since the act of the P to purchase the cement was in the ordinary course of business with the authority of the partner, however wrongful use by the partner will make the firm liable to the same extent as the partner for loss or injury caused to D.  However, POR Associates can take action against P, the partner.           3(b)(i)    Conditions for an institution to be notified as PFI (Section 2(72) of the Companies Act, 2013: No institution shall be so notified unless—  (A)  (B)  it has been established or constituted by or under any Central or State Act other than this Act or the previous Companies Law; or  not less than fifty-one per cent of the paid-up share capital is held or controlled by the Central Government or by any State Government or Governments or partly by the Central Government and partly by one or more State Governments.  In the instant case, the major shareholders holding paid-up share capital in Rural Development Fin. Corp. Ltd. by the Central Government and State Governments is 68% (i.e. Central Government: 26%, State of Maharashtra: 18% and State of Tamilnadu: 24%), hence it will be regarded as ‘Public Financial Institution’ under the Companies Act, 2013.  By virtue of Section 2(72) of the Companies Act, 2013, the following institutions are to be regarded as public financial institutions:  (i)  (ii) (iii)  (iv)  (v)  the Life Insurance Corporation of India, established under the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956;  the Infrastructure Development Finance Company Limited,  specified company referred to in the Unit Trust of India (Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal) Act, 2002;  institutions notified by the Central Government under section 4A(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 so repealed under section 465 of this Act;  such other institution as may be notified by the Central Government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India.     3(b)(ii)  No, it is not mandatory to have common seal for the company.  S In case a company does not have a common seal, the authorization shali be Hp made by two directors or by a director and the Company Secretary, wherever the company has appointed a Company Secretary.   3(c)  Some of the agreements which are held to be opposed to public policy are-  Trading with enemy: Any trade with person owing allegiance to a Government at war with India without the licence of the Government of India is void, as the object is opposed to public policy. Here, the agreement to trade offends against the public policy by tending to prejudice the interest of the State in times of war.  Stifling Prosecution: An agreement to stifle prosecution i.e. “an agreement  to present proceedings already instituted from running their normal course | < $e | using force” tends to be a perversion or an abuse of justice; therefore, such an agreement is void. The principle is that one should not make a trade of felony.  The compromise of any public offence is generally illegal.  Under the Indian Criminal Procedure Code, there is, however, a statutory list  of compoundable offences and an agreement to drop proceeding relating to  such offences with or without the permission of the Court, as the case may be,  in consideration the accused promising to do something for the complainant,  is not opposed to public policy.  Maintenance and Champerty: Maintenance is an agreement in which a person promises to maintain suit in which he has no interest.  (4)  (5)  (6)  (7)  (8)  (9)  Champerty is an agreement in which a person agrees to assist another in litigation in-exchange of a promise to hand over a portion of the proceeds of the action.  (a) It is unreasonable so as to be unjust to other party or  (b) It is made by a malicious motive like that of gambling in litigation or oppressing other party by encouraging unrighteous suits and not with the bonafide object of assisting a claim believed to be just.  Trafficking relating to Public Offices and titles: An agreement to trafficking in public office is opposed to public policy, as it interferes with the appointment of a person best qualified for the service of the public. Public policy requires that there should be no money consideration for the appointment to an office in which the public is interested. The following are the examples of agreements that are void; since they are tantamount to sale of public offices.  (1) Anagreement to pay money to a public servant in order to induce him to retire from his office so that another person may secure the appointment is void.  (2) An agreement to procure a public recognition like Padma Vibhushan for reward is void.  Agreements tending to create monopolies: Agreements having for their object the establishment of monopolies are opposed to public policy and therefore void.  Marriage brokerage agreements: An agreement to negotiate marriage for reward, which is known as a marriage brokerage contract, is void, as it is opposed to public policy.  Interference with the course of justice: An agreement whose object is to induce any judicial officer of the State to act partially or corruptly is void, as it is opposed to public policy.  Interest against obligation: The following are examples of agreement that are void as they tend to create an interest against obligation. The object of such agreements is opposed to public policy.  (1) An agreement by an agent to receive without his principal’s consent compensation from another for the performance of his agency is invalid.  (2) A, who is the manager of a firm, agrees to pass a contract to X if X pays to A Rs. 200,000 privately; the agreement is void.  Consideration Unlawful in Part: By virtue of Section 24, if any part of a single consideration for one or more objects, or any one or any part of any  siep])    one of several considerations for a single object, is unlawful, the agreement is void.”  This section is an obvious consequence of the general principle of Section 23. There is no promise for a lawful consideration if there is anything illegal in a consideration which must be taken as a whole. The general rule is that where the legal part of a contract can be severed from the illegal part, the bad part may be rejected and the good one can be retained. But where the illegal part cannot be severed, the contract is altogether void.  (Any six points are to be considered as an adequate answer)    4(a)   Section 42 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 requires that when two or more persons have made a joint promise, then, unless a contrary intention appears from the contract, all such persons jointly must fulfil the promise. In the event of the death of any of them, his representative jointly with the survivors and in case of the death of all promisors, the representatives of all jointly must fulfil the promise.  Section 43 allows the promisee to seek performance from any of the joint promisors. The [liability of the joint promisors has thus been made not only joint but “joint and several”. Section 43 provides that in the absence of express agreement to the contrary, the promisee may compel any one or more of the joint promisors to perform the whole of the promise.  Section 43 deals with the contribution among joint promisors. The promisors, may compel every joint promisor to contribute equally to the performance of the promise (unless a contrary intention appears from the contract). If any one of the joint promisors makes default in such contribution the remaining joint promusors must bear the loss arising from such default in equal shares.  In the instant case,  (i) D can compei any of three parties A, B and C to pay him Rs. 6,000.  (ii) (1) C can recover the contribution from A and B because A, B and C are joint promisors.  ol  \\ \\ \\ *  Step]  Step]  Sjep 2  C is entitled to receive Rs. 3,000 from B.      4(b) Rules as to compensation (Section 117 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881)  The compensation payable in case of dishonour of promissory note, bill of exchange  or cheque, by any party liable to the holder or any endorsee, shall be determined by the following rules:  (a) the holder is entitled to the amount due upon the instrument, together with the expenses properly incurred in presenting, noting and protesting it;  (b) when the person charged resides at a place different from that at which the instrument was payable, the holder is entitled to receive such sum at the current rate of exchange between the two places;  (c) anendorser who, being liable, has paid the amount due on the same is entitled to the amount so paid with interest at 18% per annum from the date of | Ste | payment until tender or realisation thereof, together with all expenses caused by the dishonour and payment;  (d) | when the person charged and such endorser reside at different places, the endorser is entitled to receive such sum at the current rate of exchange between the two places;  (e) the party entitled to compensation may draw a bill upon the party liable to compensate him, payable at sight or on demand, for the amount due to him, together with all expenses properly incurred by him. Such bill must be accompanied by the instrument dishonoured and the protest thereof (if any). If such bili is dishonoured, the party dishonouring the same is liable to make compensation thereof in the same manner as in the case of the original bill.    Answer 4(c)  The functions of judiciary system of India are:  4 Regulation of the interpretation of the Acts and Codes, > Dispute Resolution, Step | e Promotion of fairness among the citizens of the land.    In the hierarchy of courts, the Supreme Court is at the top, followed by the Hig Courts and District Courts. Decisions of a High Court are binding in the respective state but are only persuasive in other states. Decisions of the Supreme Court are binding on all High Courts under Article 141 of the Indian Constitution. In fact, a Supreme Court decision is the final word on the matter.  {i} Supreme Court  The Supreme Court is the apex body of the judiciary. It was established on 26th January, 1950. The Chief Justice of India is the highest authority appointed under Article 126. The principal bench of the Supreme Court consists of seven members including the Chief Justice of India. Presently, the number has increased to 34 including the Chief Justice of India due to the rise in the number of cases and workload. An individual can seek relief in the Supreme Court by filing a writ petition under Article 32.  Stepeu  (ii) High Court  The highest court of appeal in each state and union territory is the High Court. Article 214 of the Indian Constitution states that there must be a High Court in each state. The High Court has appellant, original jurisdiction, and Supervisory jurisdiction. However, Article 227 of the Indian Constitution limits a High Court’s supervisory power. In India, there are twenty-five High Courts, one for each state and union territory. Six states share a single High Court. An individual can seek remedies against violation of fundamental rights in High Court by filing a writ under Article 226.  (ii) District Court  Below the High Courts are the District Courts. The Courts of District Judge deal with Civil law matters i.e. contractual disputes and claims for damages etc., The Courts of Sessions deals with Criminal matters.  Under pecuniary jurisdiction, a civil judge can try suits valuing not more than Rupees two crore.  Jurisdiction means the power to control. Courts get territorial Jurisdiction based on the areas covered by them. Cases are decided based on the local limits within which the parties reside or the property under dispute is situated.  {iv} Metropolitan courts  Metropolitan courts are established in metropolitan cities in consultation with the  High Court where the population is ten lakh or more. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Step 2. has powers as Chief Judicial Magistrate and Metropolitan Magistrate has powers as  the Court of a Magistrate of the first class.   5(a) Delivery of the goods to the carrier [Section 23(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930]: Where, in pursuance of the contract, the seller delivers the goods to the buyer or to a carrier or other bailee (whether named by the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, and does not reserve the right of disposal, he is deemed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to the contract.  Step]  In the instant case, the Institute of Science, Pune placed an order for various  chemicals worth Rs. 1,50,000 from a supplier in Delhi. The seller dispatched  the consignment via a courier without reserving any right of disposal over the  goods. The consignment was lost in transit. According to Section 23(2), it is S4ep rw an unconditional appropriation of goods because of which the Institute of  Science, Pune (buyer) has become the owner of the goods. Therefore, it will  bear the risk of loss of the consignment in the way. Hence, the buyer’s claim  is not valid.   Answer 5(a)(ii)  Condition as to Merchantability [Section 16(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930]: Where goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in | S*ep]  goods of that description (whether he is the manufacturer or producer or not), there is an implied condition that the goods shall be of merchantable quality.  There are two requirements for this condition to apply: (a) | Goods should be bought by description.  (b) The seller should be a dealer in goods of that description. <lep | Provided that, if the buyer has examined the goods, there shall be no implied  condition as regards defects which such examination oughi to have revealed.  <4  The expression “merchantable quality”, though not defined, nevertheless connotes goods of such a quality and in such a condition a man of ordinary prudence would accept them as goods of that description. It does not imply any legal right or legal title to sell.  In the instant case, the defect in the engine could not have been detected even with a reasonable inspection.  Stepr Therefore, Adarsh can invoke the implied condition of merchantability and is entitled te repudiate the contract due to the defect in the car.    5(b) Partner by holding out (Section 28 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932): Where a man holds himself out as a partner. or allows others to do it, he is then stopped from denying the character he has assumed Step and upon the faith of which creditors may be presumed to have acted.  (2) Nominal Partner: A person who lends his name to the firm, without having any real interest in it, is called a nominal partner.  He is not entitled to share the profits of the firm. Neither he invests in Stepd the firm nor takes part in the conduct of the business. He is, however liable to third parties for all acts of the firm.    Answer 5(b)(ii)  (i) Dissolution by Agreement (Section 40 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932):  Section 40 gives right to the partners to dissolve the partnership by agreement with the consent of all the partners or in accordance with a  contract between the partners. ‘Contract between the partners’ means Step a contract already made.  Hence, the statement ‘dissolution of a firm by the consent of the majority of the partners is not correct unless otherwise provided in a contract between them.  (ii) Compulsory dissolution (Section 41): A firm is compulsorily dissolved  > By the adjudication of all the partners or of all the partners but one as insolvent; or  S+ep 2 > by the happening of any event which makes it unlawful for the  business of the firm to be carried on or for the partners to carry it on in partnership.  Hence, the statement ‘compulsory dissolution requires an order from the court’ is not correct.    Answer 5(c) (i) Undue influence (Section 16) According to section 16 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, “A contract is said to be induced by ‘undue influence’ where the relations subsisting between the parties are Sieb |  such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and he uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other”.  _  a” a“  (ii) Position to dominate the wiil: Relation between the parties exist in such a manner that one of them is in a position to dominate the will of the other. A person is deemed to be in such position in the following circumstances:  (a) Real and apparent authority: Where a person holds a real authority over the other as in the case of master and servant, doctor and patient and etc.  (b) Fiduciary relationship: Where relation of trust and confidence exists between the parties to a contract. Such type of relationship exists between father and son, solicitor and client, husband and wife, creditor Steb2 and debtor, etc.  (c) Mental distress: An undue influence can be used against a person to get his consent on a contract where the mental capacity of the person is temporarily or permanently affected by the reason of mental or bodily distress, illness or of old age.  (d) Unconscionable bargains: Where one of the parties to a contract is in a position to dominate the will of the other and the contract is apparently unconscionable i.e., unfair, it is presumed by law that consent must have been obtained by undue influence. Unconscionable bargains are witnessed mostly in money-lending transactions and in gifts.    Answer 6(a){i)   Section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 reads as “Where one person  signs and delivers to another a paper stamped in accordance with the law relating to negotiable instruments then in force in India, and either wholly blank or having  written thereon an incomplete negotiable instrument, he thereby gives prima facie  authority to the holder thereof to make or complete, as the case may be, upon it a Sieh ]} negotiable instrument, for any amount specified therein and not exceeding the  amount covered by the stamp.  The person so signing shall be liable upon such instrument, in the capacity in which he signed the same, to any holder in due course for such amount. Provided that no person other than a holder in due course shall recover from the person delivering the  4  a  instrument anything in excess of the amount intended by him to be paid thereunder”. | Step |  In the instant case, Anjali is not liable to honour the promissory note to Manish for Rs. 17000. She is liable only for Rs. 15000. Stepr    Answer 6(a)(ii)      Presentment for payment [Section 64 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881]  As per section 64 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, promissory notes, bill of exchange and cheques must be presented for payment to the maker, acceptor or  drawee thereof respectively, by or on behalf of the holder as hereinafter provided.  Step] In default of such presentment, the other parties thereto are not liable thereon to such P holder.  So, presentment for payment must be made to the person primarily liable on the instrument, or in their absence, at the proper place during the usual business hours.  In this case, Priya presented the bill at Sanjay’s office during regular business hours, but since Sanjay was not present, she left the bill with his assistant.  While leaving the bill with the assistant might be considered a practical step, it does not fulfil the strict legal requirement of presenting the bill directly to the drawee | Se bo  (Sanjay) or his authorised representative for payment.  Therefore, the presentation of the bill by Priya to Sanjay’s assistant is not valid under law.   Answer 6(b) t\\  \\ \\  Agent’s authority in an emergency [Section 189 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872]: An agent has authority, in an emergency, to do all such acts for the purpose of protecting his principal from loss as would be done by a person of ordinary prudence, in his own case, under similar circumstances.  To constitute a valid agency in an emergency, following conditions must be satisfied:  (i) Agent should not be in a position or have any opportunity to Ske | communicate with his principal within the time available.  (ii) There should have been actual and definite commercial necessity for the agent to act promptly.  (iii) the agent should have acted bonafide and for the benefit of the principal.  (iv) the agent should have adopted the most reasonable and practicable course under the circumstances, and  (v) the agent must have been in possession of the goods belonging to his principal and which are the subject of contract.      Answer 6(b) Under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, both a sub-agent and a substituted agent are  appointed by the agent. But, however, the following are the points of distinction between the two.

(Any six points are to be considered as an adequate answer)    Answer 6(c)  If the seller commits a breach of contract, the buyer gets the following rights against the seller:  1. Damages for non-delivery [Section 57 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930]: Where the seller wrongfully neglects or refuses to deliver the goods to the buyer, the buyer may sue the seller for damages for non-delivery.  2. Suit for specific performance (Section 58): Where the seller commits of breach of the contract of sale, the buyer can appeal to the court for specific Step] performance. The court can order for specific performance only when the goods are ascertained or specific. This remedy is allowed by the court subject to these conditions: (a) The contract must be for the sale of specific and ascertained goods.  (b) The power of the court to order specific performance is subject to provisions of the Specific Relief Act of 1963.  (c) It empowers the court to order specific performance where damages would not be an adequate remedy.  (d) it will be granted as remedy if goods are of special nature or are unique.  a Suit for breach of warranty (Section 59): Where there is breach of warranty on the part of the seller, or where the buyer elects to treat breach of condition as breach of warranty, the buyer is not entitled to reject the goods only on the basis of such breach of warranty. But he may —  (i) set up against the seller the breach of warranty in diminution or extinction of the price; or  (ii) sue the seller for damages for breach of warranty.  4. Repudiation of contract before due date (Section 60): Where either party | $+ep/] to a contract of sale repudiates the contract before the date of delivery, the other may either treat the contract as subsisting and wait till the date of delivery, or he may treat the contract as rescinded and sue for damages for the breach.  5. Suit for interest:  (1) Nothing in this Act shall affect the right of the seller or the buyer to recover interest or special damages, in any case where by law interest or special damages may be recoverable, or to recover the money paid where the consideration for the payment of it has failed.  (2) In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the court may award interest at such rate as it thinks fit on the amount of the price to the buyer in a suit filed by him for the refund of the price (in a case of a breach of the contract on the part of the seller) from the date on which the payment was made.\n",
